Like other big cities, Philadelphia also experiences daily traffic congestions, particularly during peak commuting hours. Congestion not only increases travel times but also contributes to higher fuel consumption, air pollution, and commuter frustration. The city’s aging traffic signal infrastructure often relies on static timing plans that fail to adapt to real-time traffic conditions, exacerbating delays at critical intersections. By leveraging real-time traffic data, machine learning, and geospatial analysis, Philadelphia can adopt adaptive traffic signal control systems to dynamically adjust signal timings based on current traffic conditions. Such a system would not only reduce congestion but also improve safety, enhance air quality, and support the city’s broader goals of sustainable and efficient urban mobility.

This project aims to develop an adaptive traffic signal optimization system through machine learning tools, using real-time traffic sensor data, historical traffic patterns, and transportation data.
